# ex01 - How to use the Build Your First Network (byfn) example

## Requirements
As requirements for this example I assume a running fabric 1.4.6 installation, golang and node.js is already installed to the corresponding documentation.

## Tasks

### (1) First Try
In this example we are going to investigate the byfn.sh script and play with the pre-installed chaincode **chaincode_example_02.go**.

1. Start the byfn.sh script and try the example chaincode_example_02. Analyse which container are running.
2. Analyse the chaincode. Find out which transactions can be done.
3. Use the cli container to interact with the chaincode.
4. Stop the byfn.sh script and start it again. Are you data still available?
